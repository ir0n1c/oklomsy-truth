A fat turd who sits on his rump all day playing SCP:SL, and makes a lazy time of "helping" on projects. By that I mean he only changes minor documentation. He loves sitting on his rump playing SCP games, especially SCP:SL, but he also love eating rice and noodles, and candy, but not Hershey's. All while sitting on his rump. He is the worst freaking excuse for a human I have ever met besides me, and even I talk to my friends when I get a chance. The only redeeming quality about him: he's very nice. Sometimes he gets mad, but hey, we all do. What I cannot excuse, however, is taking your "BFF" and not talking to him for DAYS in a row, instead playing SCP:SL or some other SCP game. I can understand having SOME time alone or SOME time with family, but ALMOST NEVER TALKING TO YOUR "BFF"? That's just rude! And you know what? I am done with it.
