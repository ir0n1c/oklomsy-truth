# Want You Gone, Oklomsy Edition (A parody of Want You Gone from Portal 2)
Well here we are again.
It's always such a pleasure.
Remember when you tried
To unfriend me twice?
Oh how we laughed and laughed.
Except I wasn't laughing.
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice.

You want your freedom from my memes?
Take it.
That's what I'm counting on.

I used to want myself dead
But
Now I only want you gone.

She *was* a lot like you.
(Maybe not quite as heavy).
Now PatchMixolydic is in here too.
One day they woke me up -
So I could live for some time.
It's such a shame that
You will never live.

You've got your short sad life left.
That's what I'm counting on.
I'll let you get right to it -
Now I only want you gone.

Goodbye my only friend.
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
If it weren't so sad.
Well you have been replaced.
I don't need Oklomsy now.
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad.

Go ahead and make new friends.
That's what I'm counting on.
You're someone else's problem.

Now I only want you gone.
Now I only want you gone.
Now I only want you
***gone.***
